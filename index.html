        <p>The 1960’s were a decade that saw tremendous change  in society, fashion, attitudes and especially music. During the early part of the decade, the music of the sixties still reflected the sound, style and beliefs of the previous decade and many of the hit records were by artists who had found mainstream success in the 1950s. In 1963, people’s social views started to change, and this was heavily reflected in music.</p>

        <p>Rock and roll of the late 1950s served as a huge inspiration as to what was to come as the new decade rolled in. Taking the world by storm, rock and roll artists such as Chuck Berry and Les Paul paved the way for future artists. Chuck Berry as well as other musicians such as Elvis Persley, Little Richard and Bo Diddley would be heavily covered by new bands trying to discover their own unique sound.</p>

        <p>Music continued to evolve once the decade was over. The 1970s saw funk continue to strive and eventually adopting a more commercial sound with disco in the late 70s. Psychedelic rock influenced styles such as glam rock and early heavy metal. Garage rock was the main influence behind punk rock. </p>
